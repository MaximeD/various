# Miscellaneous scripts

- **gm_fill_user_name_and_pass.user.js** is simple javascript you can use with greasemonkey to autofill informations on websites where security is not critical

- **random_show** will launch your favourite video player on a random video file from a given directory.
I wanted to mess a bit with C, recursivity and linked list.
syntax :
```shell
random_show directory video_player
```

## page_rank

- **page_rank.rb** is a basic script to compute the page rank of web pages a la google, in a simplier way.

## shell

- **nv_cours** creates a new file named after the current day and adds some LaTeX infos in.
  You'll probably won't need it but as it was my first shell script I had to put it there.

- **vacuum.sh** will VACUUM firefox (and thunderbird) sqlite databases improving their performances. Try it!
